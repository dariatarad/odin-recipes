            <em><h3>Special Gnocchi recipe with Tomato Sauce and Mozzarella</h3></em>
        </p>
        
        <p>Ingridients:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ (14.5 ounce) cans passata (crushed tomatoes)</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) package potato gnocchi</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, cubed</li>
            <li>4 fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Directions:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook onion until soft and translucent, 
                about 5 minutes. Add passata and salt; simmer over low heat while you prepare the gnocchi.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until 
                they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 ladle of tomato sauce into the bottom of a baking dish. Add gnocchi, remaining tomato 
                sauce, and Parmesan cheese; toss to combine. Arrange cubes of mozzarella cheese evenly on top.</li>
            <li>Place baking dish in the oven and broil until mozzarella cheese is melted and sauce has slightly 
                reduced, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and garnish with basil leaves before serving.</li>            
        </ol>
